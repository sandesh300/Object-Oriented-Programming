# Object-Oriented-Programming
OOP's is abbreviated as Object-Oriented Programming, in which programs are considered as a collection of objects, where each object is an instance of a class.

At the core of OOP, we have objects and classes, much like real-world entities. 
 An object has two significant characteristics:

- Data: describes the attributes and state of the object.
- Behavior: provides the object with the ability to change itself and communicate with other objects.

Class:  is a blueprint or template of objects
Object:  is an instance of a class.
