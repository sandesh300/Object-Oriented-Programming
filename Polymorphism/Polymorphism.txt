Polymorphism :
- One name but multiple forms is concept of Polymorphism.

- Polymorphism is the concept where an object behaves differently in different situations. 

- example-
1. A man can be a many things like father, writer, student, employee etc. Same person can have different role.


- There are two types of polymorphism - 
1. Compile time polymorphism. 
2. Runtime polymorphism. 

- We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading i.e. Conpile time polymorphism and method overriding i.e Runtime Polymorphism.

- Overloading :
- Two methods are said to be overloaded if and only both methods having same name but different arguments / parameters is called compile time polymorphism or static polymorphism or early Binding.

- In overloading, method resolution always takes care by compiler based on reference type hence overloading is also considered as compile time polymorphism.

Overriding :
- when a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameter and same return type as a method in its superclass, then the method in a subclass is said to overriding the method in a superclass. It is runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism or late binding.

- In overriding, method resolution always takes care by JVM based on runtime object and hence overriding is also considered as runtime polymorphism.
